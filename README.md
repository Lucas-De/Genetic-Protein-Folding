# Evolutionary Algorithm:

POPULATION : Number of proteins in a gneration
GENERATIONS : Number of generations
CARRYOVER : Number of parents selected to generate children
TOP : Number of top proteins to be cloned to the next generation
PROB_TYPE1 : Single Rotation probability
PROB_TYPE2 : Double Rotation probability
PROB_TYPE3 = : Crank mutation probability
Note that the probability the retracing mutation is extrapolated from values above


PROTECTION : If true child protection is activated
PROTECTION_GEN : Number of generations for which to protect top children

GRAPHICS : If true algorithm will run with graphics
RUNS : Number of total algorithm runs

CHAIN : String of Amino acid "H","C", "P" for which the optimal stability should be found
